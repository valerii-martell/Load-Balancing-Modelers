[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/35d4bbf96265499bb39d06826ff3376b)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/valerii-martell/Load-Balancing-Modelers/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=valerii-martell/Load-Balancing-Modelers&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

A set of desktop programs for modeling the immersion of graphs of parallel programs (static load balancing) in computer systems of
various architecture (fully connected, lattice, star, Common Bus, Token Bus, Token Ring, FDDI, etc.) using (heterogeneous) earliest finish time algorithm (HEFT or EFT).

**Technology stack:**
1. C#, Xamarin, Microsoft Excel API
2. Java, JavaFX

The most compleated according to the best practises of Software Engineering project in this repository is

Realised graphical interface (MVC), saving and loading graphs of parallel programs (XML) and the immersion result (png), built-in assistant.
